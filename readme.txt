# FastReader Chrome Extension

## Purpose
The FastReader Chrome Extension is designed to enhance reading speed by presenting individual words in a flashed sequence. This approach allows users to read at speeds of up to 450 words per minute, leveraging the natural speed at which the human brain can process information. Additionally, the extension aims to assist individuals with ADHD in improving concentration and focus.

## Credits
This extension is a collaborative effort, with all code authored by Michi Tanaka and assistance from the ChatGPT language model by OpenAI.
